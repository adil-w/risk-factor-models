# The Application of Risk Factor Models to Understand Investment Risks

There are many aspects that play a role in making investment decisions, and measuring the systematic risks of an investment is a fundamental part of deciding on what stocks to include in your portfolio. 

This project studies the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Fama-French 3-Factor Model using Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries. These models are applied to a dataset that includes over 1,300 stocks. The stock data and the monthly market factor returns are downloaded from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS). Please refer to the file *wrds_instructions.pdf* for instructions on how to download the datasets from WRDS.
